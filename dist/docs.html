        <div style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #00ff88">Creating a Key</div>
        <p>Currently we are providing a free sample in <a href="plans.html" style="cursor: pointer;">plans</a>. Please use the first section of the page to Create an Account. Make sure to safely store your Master Password, because we do NOT store it anywhere, and if your lose it, we cannot help you. The successful creation of an account generates an API Key. Please store it somewhere.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #00ff88">Encrypting and Decrypting Passwords</div>
        <p>In the Store Password section, enter the details asked. On successful execution, it generates a Password ID. You can use this ID in the Retrieve section to decrypt the password using your Master Password.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #00ff88">Sharing a Password</div>
        <p>In the Share With Team section, enter the Password ID (Not the Password) of the password you want to share, and the API Keys of the teammates or employees you wish to share it with. It generates a share token for each of them. Please copy those and send to them in order to securely share your password.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #00ff88">Creating a Share Group</div>
        <p>Go to the Create Share Group section. Give it any name and click the Create button. Successful group creation would create a Group Id. Please save it. To add members to this group, go to the Add Member to Group section. Input the Group Id and the API Key of the intended member. They will get added to the Share Group. Follow the same approach to remove members from your Share Group.</p>
        <br/>
        <div style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #00ff88" id="sharing">Sharing Guide</div>
        <p>The beauty of QuantumSure is in the ability it grants to the client to share passwords without the need to share them across the internet in plain text form. It can also enable your generated access tokens (for example Google or AWS auth tokens) to be directly used by your team without the need of giving an actual token to them.</p>
        <p>Generate an auth token: This is anything from Google Docs to Amazon Cloud Services.</p>
        <p>Store the token: Use the <a href="./plans.html" style='cursor:pointer;'>Plans</a> page to Store Password. Use the Share Password option to create a Share Token.</p>
        <p>Frontend Access: In the frontend that your employees/team use, include <a style="cursor:pointer;">this function</a> to have them fetch the encrypted token, and <a style="cursor:pointer;">this function</a> to decrypt it. Then directly use it in your call to the Amazon or Google service call. This way, they can work with your tokens without needing to know or access them directly.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #00ff88" id="bestpractices">Best Security Practices</div>
        <p>Please DO NOT share your Master Password or public_key with anyone, because that would allow them to delete your account, and they will also be able to generate a lot of training data by using your keys to generate encrypted text for normal text data.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #00ff88" id="tech">QuantumSure Encryption at a Glance</div>
        <p>QuantumSure uses multiple encryption algorithms, and decoy mechanics to ensure the safety of your data, and its resistance to hacking and unauthorized access, even when pitted against Quantum Computers. The technology involves Kyber1024, Fernet-like, and decoy based encryption.</p>
        <p><a>Kyber 1024:</a> Kyber is an IND-CCA2-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)<a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="to_kyber();">[1]</a>, whose security is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. Kyber is one of the finalists in the NIST post-quantum cryptography project. The submission lists three different parameter sets aiming at different security levels. Specifically, Kyber-512 aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-128, Kyber-768 aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-192, and Kyber-1024 aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-256.<br/>
        The design of the Kyber encryption is rooted in the seminal LWE-based encryption scheme of Regev. Since Regev's original work, the practical efficiency of LWE encryption schemes has been improved by observing that the secret in LWE can come from the same distribution as the noise and also noticing that "LWE-like" schemes can be built by using a square (rather than a rectangular) matrix as the public key. Another improvement was applying an idea originally used in the NTRU cryptosystem to define the Ring-LWE and Module-LWE problems that used polynomial rings rather than integers. The CCA-secure KEM Kyber is built on top of a CPA-secure cryptosystem that is based on the hardness of Module-LWE.
        </p>
        <p><a>Fernet-like Encryption:</a> Fernet guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key. Fernet is an implementation of symmetric (also known as “secret key”) authenticated cryptography. Fernet also has support for implementing key rotation via MultiFernet. <a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="to_fernet();">[2]</a> <br/>
        It uses the following processes internally: <br/>
        -AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption; using PKCS7 padding.<br/>
        -HMAC using SHA256 for authentication.<br/>
        -Initialization vectors are generated using random number generators.<br/>
        Since the original implementation of Fernet is in Python, QuantumSure calls its method "Fernet-like Encryption" because it is built in a different language (javascript), and uses additional safety checks to make it even more robust. This method is built using the ChaCha20 library in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p><a>Decoy-based Encryption:</a> This is a unique implementation, specially created in-house by the QuantumSure cryptographers. It involves generating a key that serves no purpose, and adding it to the data QuantumSure stores, that leads to potential malicious parties getting 'keys' that don't truly do anything, thereby wasting their time and resources to decipher bits of data that are totally useless.</p>
